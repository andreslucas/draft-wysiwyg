## 1.1.- Overview
Draft.js is a framework for *building rich text editors* in React, powered by an immutable model and abstracting over cross-browser differences.

Draft.js makes it easy to build any type of rich text input, whether you're just looking to support a few inline text styles or building a complex text editor for composing long-form articles.

In Draft.js, everything is customizable – Facebook provides the building blocks to have full control over the user interface.
